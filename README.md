- In this case, the source folder (Telegram Desktop), the destination folder (python learning) and the executable file are in the Desktop directory.
# For Python users:
- Put the main.py file in the same directory with your source and destination folders;
- Run the file;
- Input names of the folders;
- Input key words contained in the files' names you'd like to filter;
- Watch magic!
# Without Python:
- Try filesfilter.exe, remember to put it into the same directory with your source and destination folders!
