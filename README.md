- In this case, the source folder (Telegram Desktop), the destination folder (python learning) and the executable file are in the Desktop directory.
# For Python users:
- Place the main.py file to a directory with a folder that needs to be filtered. 
- Then, create a folder in the same directory where you are going to filter your files. 
- Run the main.py file. Input your source and destination folders names and then put a keyword that is contained in the files' names. Letter case does not matter.
- Watch magic!
# Without Python:
- You can try the filesfilter.exe on your computer if you do not have Python installed
- Put the .exe file in the same directory with your source and destination folders and then run the .exe
